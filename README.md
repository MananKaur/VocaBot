# VocaBot

Often we have different choices of websites to visit for finding the meaning, synonyms, antonyms of a word and it's use in a sentence.
For that matter is this bot for WhatsApp that ensures saving time using an automated script which gives you the direct accessibility of getting information from your wishful sites in one place. You can change the links in the JSON file and you are good to go! 

The script uses nodeJS and Puppeteer to serve the purpose. The user may give a word and choose one out of 5 options that the script offers as per his requirement and use. At any point, if he wants to exit, he may exit by pressing 5.
